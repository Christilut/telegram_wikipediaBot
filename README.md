# telegram_wikipediaBot
Wikipedia bot for Telegram

Works with unicode.

Run it with a Telegram bot token as first argument, for example:

coffee wikipediabot.coffee ABC123TOKEN

Example bot in action: https://telegram.me/wikipediarobot

You can use this bot in any way you like.

Note that I used a patched version of node-telegram-bot, which is why it is included in this repo and not added with NPM.
